# Project Description
This project is a simulation/workaround for a 3 degree of freedom (DOF) per leg hexapod robot named Tiffany. <br>
Robot is https://github.com/Penguin-Lab/tiffany.  <br>

# Modeling and Tools
It was firstly prototyped using Autodesk Fusion, then .step exported.<br>
![Fusion Model](./fusion.png)
# Figure 1 - Fusion Model
.step files were inserted, duplicated and mirrowed into a assembly, mate connectors joined parts and set degrees of freedom.

# Figure 2 - Onshape Model

# Exporting
onshape-to-robot was used to convert the onshape model assembly into .urdf, which is the description of the robot. <br>

If you want to use your own hexapod model, you should add a keys and a config.json file in a folder
To get the API keys, follow the onshape-to-robot documentation
the key textis formatted as follow: <br>
```
export ONSHAPE_API=https://cad.onshape.com
export ONSHAPE_ACCESS_KEY=https://onshape-to-robot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#using-bashrc
export ONSHAPE_SECRET_KEY=https://onshape-to-robot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#using-bashrc
```

The config.json file should look like this:

```
{        
    "documentId": "https://onshape-to-robot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html",
    "outputFormat": "urdf",
    "assemblyName": "robot",
    "ignore": {
        "CORPO_CENTER": "collision"
    }
}

```


```
pip install onshape-to-robot
```
then, source your keys using:


```
source keys
```
# (In Development)
Refining the kinematics inside pybullet before going through ros and gazebo implementation.

## Setting things up
### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SENAI4LIFE/tiffany_sim.git
```

### Create virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate environment
```bash
source ~/venv/bin/activate
```
Shortcut
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

Paste at the end of bash:
```bash
alias venv='source ~/venv/bin/activate'
alias tiffanypy='cd tiffany_sim/workspace/pybullet'
alias tiffanygz='cd tiffany_sim/workspace/gazebosim'
```

# (PyBullet) 
## Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd ~/tiffany_sim/workspace/pybullet
```

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pybullet
pip install numpy
```

### Start Simulation
```bash
python3 main.py
```
